                    <h1>Portifolio</h1>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>My name is <strong>Claudine Kuradusenge</strong>. My Portifolio is mostly related to what i have accomplished so far at Moringa School and at school from primary up to university level. As you can see in my portifolio, i had no programming skills before joining Moringa School, but something i have noticed along the way is that background in programming doesn't really matter a lot. You can start learning how to code from where you are at any ages. And it really requires to be patient and to maintain persistence. </p>
